//approach is too simple as we know we have to remove occurances of same character which 
//have min. value in given vector, so what we have to do we will find the sum of all values of 
//total equal characters and delete the maximum value character from that sum and add it to 
//finalcost variable  let me explain 

//ex
//"aaabbbabbbb"
//[3,5,10,7,5,3,5,5,4,8,1]

//we can see first three 'a's  have value 3,5,10 and thier sum is 18 and the max. value in that 
//10 so will subtract (sum-max)==(18-10)==8 and just add it to the another varaiable  
//finalcost this process will follow in whole string 
//for more clarification just go through the code





   int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
   int finalcost=0;
   char curr=colors[0];
   int maxi=neededTime[0];
   int sum=neededTime[0];
   int i=1;
   while(i<colors.size())
   {
   	if(curr==colors[i])    // if characters are same 
   	{
     maxi=max(maxi,neededTime[i]);    
     sum+=neededTime[i];            //all values are added to the sum 
   	}
   	else
   	{
   		// cout<<i<<endl;
      finalcost+=(sum-maxi);       // when characters are not equal then just subtract maximum value from sum 
      curr=colors[i];            // update curr
      maxi=neededTime[i];       // update maxi
      sum=neededTime[i];       // update sum 
   	}
   	i++;
   }
   finalcost+=(sum-maxi);      // for last window 
   return finalcost;
    }
